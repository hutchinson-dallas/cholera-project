                <h2>My Design Process</h2>
                <p><br>The first step I took in this project was testing out basic d3 functions and experimenting with the data we were given. A basic understanding
                of the data features and what each row in the files represented gave me a good idea what sort of visuals might be useful. After that I started to sketch out
                what my first design would be. I have experience in creating R Shiny dashboards so I looked to documentation and examples of Shiny apps people built for
                inspiration. Below is my first sketch and outline of my dashboard style visualization.</p>
                <center>
                <img class="rotate_image" src="design2.jpg" height="300" width="200"/>
                </center>
                <p>It has the basic dashboard elements of a header bar and sidebar navigation on the left with different links to alternate pages. I initially thought to have
                the map of London visual take up the majority of the "main" page chunk. Then on the right would be visuals such as the deaths over time, summary statistics, 
                etc. After testing out this design theory with d3 elements, the page seemed squished and lacked the simplistic approach I wanted to take. This led to the next
                iteration of my dashboard.</p>
                <center>
                <img class="rotate_image" src="design1.jpg" height="300" width="200"/>
                </center>
                <p>This iteration was a much more simple look where each visual had enough space. This was done to ensure the end user was not overwhelmed and would then be
                able to more easily interpret the visuals/graphs present. After settling on this dashboard design, I got to work on setting up the grid system, formatting CSS,
                and declaring SVGs.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2><br>My Design Choices</h2>
                <p><br>&emsp;All of my design choices were considered with the user experience in mind. I tried to make text clear, contrast sharp, and colors purposeful.
                I also used the color brewer online tool to find good color combinations and test for color blindness contexts. For general dashboard design, the background colors
                for the header, sidebar, and main sections were chosen from well-known R Shiny examples. Links on the left have a hover color so the user knows it is clickable. I 
                also added a project title and my name into the header. The grid-like structure of the main section was chosen to give the bottom two visuals more vertical
                space since I knew they were going to be more space-heavy and prominent ones. I also added shadows to the grids for general aesthetics and gives the sense of
                depth. Lastly, I wanted to add tooltips to all visuals because they give the user more interactivity as well as information to consume with the option to not have
                that info take up as much space. Tooltips were also designed to be clear and contrast against the white background. <br>

                &emsp;For the <b>deaths by age group</b> plot, I used a single darker shade color for the bars since there would be only one variable plotted among the six
                groups (deaths). To gather this data for this graph, I created a new .csv file using Excel functions to group by age and sum the deaths by group. The x-axis label
                shows the age category and the y-axis shows number of deaths. The tooltip functionality shows the exact number of deaths for the hovered group and allows to
                restrict y-axis labels. <br>
                
                &emsp;For the <b>deaths by gender</b> plot, a similar approach was taken from the age group plot. This time however, I chose differing colors for males and females
                to not only differentiate the groups but those colors also match up with the male/female representations on the map of London. This allows the users to easily see
                gender differences in deaths and see how it matches up with the interactive map. Again, tooltips show number of deaths.<br>

                &emsp;For the <b>map of London</b> graph, I used black clear lines to sketch the map design as well as major street names. This looked best against the white
                background. Male and female deaths are encoded with the same colors as before. Pumps are encoded as black and shown relatively. The locations for the brewery and
                the work house are also shown and each have their own color to differentiate each. Tooltips were added for all death dots and pumps/location dots so it is easy to
                decipher what is what. I did attempt to add zoom functionality to the map but it doesn't work 100% as intended and users may need to refresh page to reset 
                the map. <br>

                &emsp;For the <b>timeline</b> graph, I again used a single solid color for the bars representing deaths by day. The same color from the age group chart was used
                to make it easier on the eyes. Tooltips were used again to show deaths for the hovered day of choice.

                <h2><br>Findings</h2>
                <p><br>Designing and curating the visuals really makes the user analyze the data and potentially uncover insights. Below are a few of the significant results of
                the whole project.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most affected groups of individuals by Cholera were the youngest and the oldest (0-10 and >80). The distribution here was surprising considering
                        all age groups have to consume or drink water.</li>
                    <li>There is an almost 50/50 split of females and males affected by the outbreak. This suggests males are just as likely as females to use the pumps
                        and potentially catch the disease.</li>
                    <li>The sharp slope of the timeline distribution and the right-tailed skew is also interesting to note. Cholera only takes hours or a couple days to 
                        affect/kill the individual so what we are seeing here is the quick epidemiological turnaround of the particular disease.</li>
                    <li>The concentration of deaths around Broad Street pump is something John Snow noticed and can be clearly seen from the map. There is also what seems
                        like a small divide between males and females from east and west of the pump, which may have something to do with the two locations of importance.</li>
                </ul>
